Prior work has extensively demonstrated that relevant contextual information does matter in recommender systems and that it is important to take this information into account when providing recommendations. We discuss the general notion of context and major approaches to modeling it in recommender systems, including explicit vs. latent and static vs. dynamic approaches. We also discuss three popular algorithmic paradigms---contextual pre-filtering, post-filtering, and modeling---for incorporating contextual information into the recommendation process, and survey the recent advances in contextual modeling that include tensor factorization, deep learning, and reinforcement learning techniques. We also discuss important directions for future research.},

A variety of techniques have been proposed for performing recommendation, including content-based, collaborative, knowledge-based and other techniques. To improve performance, these methods have sometimes been combined in hybrid recommenders. This paper surveys the landscape of actual and possible hybrid recommenders, and introduces a novel hybrid, EntreeC, a system that combines knowledge-based recommendation and collaborative filtering to recommend restaurants. Further, we show that semantic ratings obtained from the knowledge-based part of the system enhance the effectiveness of collaborative filtering.},

Previous methods employ sequential neural networks to encode users' historical interactions from left to right into hidden representations for making recommendations. Despite their effectiveness, we argue that such left-to-right unidirectional models are sub-optimal due to the limitations including: {\textbackslash}begin enumerate* [label=series{\textbackslash}itshape{\textbackslash}alph*{\textbackslash}upshape)] {\textbackslash}item unidirectional architectures restrict the power of hidden representation in users' behavior sequences; {\textbackslash}item they often assume a rigidly ordered sequence which is not always practical. {\textbackslash}end enumerate* To address these limitations, we proposed a sequential recommendation model called BERT4Rec, which employs the deep bidirectional self-attention to model user behavior sequences. To avoid the information leakage and efficiently train the bidirectional model, we adopt the Cloze objective to sequential recommendation, predicting the random masked items in the sequence by jointly conditioning on their left and right context. In this way, we learn a bidirectional representation model to make recommendations by allowing each item in user historical behaviors to fuse information from both left and right sides. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets show that our model outperforms various state-of-the-art sequential models consistently.},

  abstract = {Sequential recommendation systems predict the next item that a user will interact with according to the sequential patterns inferred from historical interacted items. Benefiting from the self-attention mechanism, BERT has achieved success in sequential recommendation. Nevertheless, it is still challenging to leverage multiple types of information (e.g., item IDs, attributes, timestamps) effectively under the BERT framework. Existing methods fuse different types of information as the input of BERT by directly adding or concatenating their embedding vectors. This way of fusion ignores the differences of different types of information in sequential pattern inference, which can cause the mutual interference problem and hinder the effective utilization of multi-information. In this work, we propose a Dual Disentangled Attention (DDA) based BERT model, called DDA-BERT, for better leveraging multi-information. Our model performs disentangled information modeling from two aspects: 1) different views to describe items using content information (e.g., using IDs or using attributes) are modeled in different attention heads, respectively; 2) different sequential information (time intervals, relative position distances) modeling is disentangled from content information modeling while calculating the attention scores. As a result, DDA-BERT can effectively prevent the mutual interference problem to improve the prediction accuracy. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show that DDA-BERT consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines by up to 30\%.},

The order of consumption can be very useful and matters in many scenarios. One such scenario is an educational content recommendation, where users generally follow a progressive path towards more advanced courses. Researchers have used RNNs to build sequential recommendation systems and other models that deal with sequences. Sequential Recommendation systems try to predict the next event for the user by reading their history. With the massive success of Transformers in Natural Language Processing and their usage of Attention Mechanism to better deal with sequences, there have been attempts to use this family of models as a base for a new generation of sequential recommendation systems. In this work, by converting each user's interactions with items into a series of events and basing our architecture on Transformers, we try to enable the use of such a model that takes different types of events into account. Furthermore, by recognizing that some events have to occur before some other types of events take place, we try to modify the architecture to reflect this dependency relationship and enhance the model's performance.},

By fusing the cavity convolution and forward attention, the local preference within each time window and the global preference between time windows are obtained. Fusion local and global preferences for each window. Multiple different interest embeddings are generated for each user. In the target item preference module, multiple interests learned can adaptively perceive the correlation between different target items through the attention mechanism, and the target item preference changes with the different target items.

Such systems make it difficult for a user to conclude what effect a given requirement has on the overall recommendations. This paper considers the construction of an interface to allow dynamic queries for a meta-recommender.

  abstract = {Recommender systems are an important component of many websites. Two of the most popular approaches are based on matrix factorization (MF) and Markov chains (MC). MF methods learn the general taste of a user by factorizing the matrix over observed user-item preferences. On the other hand, MC methods model sequential behavior by learning a transition graph over items that is used to predict the next action based on the recent actions of a user. In this paper, we present a method bringing both approaches together. Our method is based on personalized transition graphs over underlying Markov chains. That means for each user an own transition matrix is learned - thus in total the method uses a transition cube. As the observations for estimating the transitions are usually very limited, our method factorizes the transition cube with a pairwise interaction model which is a special case of the Tucker Decomposition. We show that our factorized personalized MC (FPMC) model subsumes both a common Markov chain and the normal matrix factorization model. For learning the model parameters, we introduce an adaption of the Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) framework for sequential basket data. Empirically, we show that our FPMC model outperforms both the common matrix factorization and the unpersonalized MC model both learned with and without factorization.},

  abstract = {Music recommender systems typically offer a ``one-size-fits-all'' approach with the same user controls and visualizations for all users. However, the effectiveness of interactive interfaces for music recommender systems is likely to be affected by individual differences. In this paper, we first conduct a comprehensive literature review of interactive interfaces in recommender systems to motivate the need for personalized interaction with music recommender systems, and two personal characteristics, ~visual memory and~musical sophistication. More specifically, we studied the influence of these characteristics on the design of (a) visualizations for enhancing recommendation diversity and (b) the optimal level of user controls while minimizing cognitive load. The results of three experiments show a benefit for personalizing both visualization and control elements to musical sophistication. We found that (1) musical sophistication influenced the acceptance of recommendations for user controls. (2) musical sophistication also influenced recommendation acceptance, and perceived diversity for visualizations and the UI combining user controls and visualizations. However, musical sophistication only strengthens the impact of UI on perceived diversity (moderation effect) when studying the combined effect of controls and visualizations. These results allow us to extend the model for personalization in music recommender systems by providing guidelines for interactive visualization design for music recommender systems, with regard to both visualizations and user control.},

Memorization of feature interactions through a wide set of cross-product feature transformations are effective and interpretable, while generalization requires more feature engineering effort. With less feature engineering, deep neural networks can generalize better to unseen feature combinations through low-dimensional dense embeddings learned for the sparse features. However, deep neural networks with embeddings can over-generalize and recommend less relevant items when the user-item interactions are sparse and high-rank. In this paper, we present Wide \& Deep learning---jointly trained wide linear models and deep neural networks---to combine the benefits of memorization and generalization for recommender systems. We productionized and evaluated the system on Google Play, a commercial mobile app store with over one billion active users and over one million apps. Online experiment results show that Wide \& Deep significantly increased app acquisitions compared with wide-only and deep-only models. We have also open-sourced our implementation in TensorFlow.},

  abstract = {In recent years, deep neural networks have yielded immense success on speech recognition, computer vision and natural language processing. However, the exploration of deep neural networks on recommender systems has received relatively less scrutiny. In this work, we strive to develop techniques based on neural networks to tackle the key problem in recommendation -- collaborative filtering -- on the basis of implicit feedback. Although some recent work has employed deep learning for recommendation, they primarily used it to model auxiliary information, such as textual descriptions of items and acoustic features of musics. When it comes to model the key factor in collaborative filtering -- the interaction between user and item features, they still resorted to matrix factorization and applied an inner product on the latent features of users and items. By replacing the inner product with a neural architecture that can learn an arbitrary function from data, we present a general framework named NCF, short for Neural network-based Collaborative Filtering. NCF is generic and can express and generalize matrix factorization under its framework. To supercharge NCF modelling with non-linearities, we propose to leverage a multi-layer perceptron to learn the user-item interaction function. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets show significant improvements of our proposed NCF framework over the state-of-the-art methods. Empirical evidence shows that using deeper layers of neural networks offers better recommendation performance.},

Still, most systems are vulnerable with certain limitations and gaps related to the recommendation environment. Several RSs do not take into account the changes of the user preference over time to ensure his satisfaction. Thus, the role of these systems is limited to define the general orientations of each user according to their observed preferences without shading light on the importance of the user preferences in short time. In this regard, we propose a new approach of recommendation for the entertainment industry that permits to guide the user towards suggestions that are more relevant according to their previous interactions. That means, we offer our users suggestions to decrease the time and frustration of discovering engaging content. Thereby, we have created our own solution, a Recommendation System based on Markov Chains and Grouping of Genres (RSMCG). It is a simple method that enables to construct an intelligent system which explores the Markov chains to predict the following actions taking into consideration the most recent actions of the user. Also, we adapt a machine learning algorithm DBSCAN clustering in order to exactly identify the interest of each user and provide adaptable answers. This approach has been studied and evaluated on the basis of a movie collection of the most popular video streaming service ``Netflix''. The results of the experiments show the efficiency of our hypothesis in comparison to a sample of the user's real needs.},

Ensuring the security of cloud computing is a major factor in the cloud computing environment, as users often store sensitive information with cloud storage providers but these providers may be untrusted. Dealing with "single cloud" providers is predicted to become less popular with customers due to risks of service availability failure and the possibility of malicious insiders in the single cloud. A movement towards "multi-clouds", or in other words, "interclouds" or "cloud-of-clouds" has emerged recently. This paper surveys recent research related to single and multi-cloud security and addresses possible solutions. It is found that the research into the use of multi-cloud providers to maintain security has received less attention from the research community than has the use of single clouds. This work aims to promote the use of multi-clouds due to its ability to reduce security risks that affect the cloud computing user.},

In terms of cloud services, it is achieved by providing and developing services that are platform-dependent with proprietary technologies, interfaces or formats. This can be a huge barrier to adopt cloud services because customers are tied to specific vendors which prevent portability through proprietary or a limited set of interfaces. As consequence, customers are hindered to alternate venders easily without substantial migration costs. A multi-cloud strategy is one possible way to avoid vendor lock-ins. The scope of the is paper is to design and implement a solution-stack to provide web services which operate independent from proprietary cloud service provider technologies. We provide a solution stack prototype which will support key functionalities such as portability, interoperability and platform-independency by implementing modern technologies and standards.},

  abstract = {Cloud users can acquire resources in the form of virtual machines (VMs) instances for computing. These instances can be on-demand, reserved and spot instances. Spot-priced virtual machines are offered at the reduced cost compared to on-demand and reserved but are unreliable to use as their availability depends on user's bid. To use spot instances (preemptible VMs), users have to bid for resources and trade-off between monetary cost and reliability as reliability increases with the increase in cost of execution. The cost of execution can be reduced significantly with the use of preemptible VM instances. These instances are only available until users bid higher in comparison with spot price that is fixed by the cloud providers. Hence, it becomes a critical challenge to minimize the associated cost and increases the reliability for a given deadline. In this article, an algorithm has been designed for predicting the spot price to facilitate the users in bidding. Further, a checkpointing algorithm has been proposed for saving the task's progress at optimal time intervals by the use of the proposed spot price prediction algorithm. The proposed algorithms in the article emphasize the use of preprocessed data for prediction of prices in short intervals. The prediction algorithm is based on machine learning techniques. It predicts the price and provides a comprehensive comparison for prediction of the prices for long term (12 h) as well as short term (10 min). For predicting the long-term and short-term prices, different machine learning techniques have been used on the basis of least error in prediction. The best suitable machine learning algorithm with least error is selected for prediction as well as checkpointing. Using these algorithms, one can improve reliability and reduce cost of computing on preemptible VM instances significantly. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt of its kind in this field.},

For these web service providers, the cost of cloud computing usage becomes a big part of their IT department cost. Facing the diverse pricing models including on-demand, reserved, and spot instance, it is difficult for web service providers to optimize their cost. This paper introduces a new cloud brokerage service to help web service providers to minimize their cloud computing cost for deadline-constrained batch jobs, which have been a significant workload in web services. Our cloud brokerage service associates each batch job with deadline, and always tries to use cheaper reserved instances for computation to maintain a minimum cost. We achieve this with the following two steps: (1) given a set of jobs' specifications, determine the scheduling of jobs, (2) given the scheduling and pricing options, find an optimal instance renting strategy. We prove that both problems in two steps are computation intractable, and propose approximation algorithms for them. Trace-based evaluation shows that our cloud brokerage service can reduce up to 57\% of the cloud computing cost.},

CloudCmp measures the elastic computing, persistent storage, and networking services offered by a cloud along metrics that directly reflect their impact on the performance of customer applications. CloudCmp strives to ensure fairness, representativeness, and compliance of these measurements while limiting measurement cost. Applying CloudCmp to four cloud providers that together account for most of the cloud customers today, we find that their offered services vary widely in performance and costs, underscoring the need for thoughtful provider selection. From case studies on three representative cloud applications, we show that CloudCmp can guide customers in selecting the best-performing provider for their applications.},

Since then, each of the major cloud computing infrastructure providers has released services supporting a similar style of deployment and operation, where rather than deploying and running monolithic services, or dedicated virtual machines, users are able to deploy individual functions, and pay only for the time that their code is actually executing. These technologies are gathered together under the marketing term "serverless" and the providers suggest that they have the potential to significantly change how client/server applications are designed, developed and operated. This paper presents two case industrial studies of early adopters, showing how migrating an application to the Lambda deployment architecture reduced hosting costs - by between 66\% and 95\% - and discusses how further adoption of this trend might influence common software architecture design practices.},

The attractiveness of cloud for HPC is the capability to run large applications on powerful, scalable hardware without needing to actually own or maintain this hardware. In this paper, we conduct a detailed comparison of HPC applications running on three cloud providers, Amazon EC2, Microsoft Azure and Rackspace. We analyze three important characteristics of HPC, deployment facilities, performance and cost efficiency and compare them to a cluster of machines. For the experiments, we used the well-known NAS parallel benchmarks as an example of general scientific HPC applications to examine the computational and communication performance. Our results show that HPC applications can run efficiently on the cloud. However, care must be taken when choosing the provider, as the differences between them are large. The best cloud provider depends on the type and behavior of the application, as well as the intended usage scenario. Furthermore, our results show that HPC in the cloud can have a higher performance and cost efficiency than a traditional cluster, up to 27\% and 41\%, respectively.},

The cost of cloud resources plays a significant role for these companies and this is why cloud resource optimization has become a very important issue. Numerous methods have been proposed to optimize cloud computing resources according to actual demand and to reduce the cost of cloud services. Such approaches mostly focus on a single factor (i.e., compute power) optimization, but this can yield unsatisfactory results in real-world cloud workloads which are multi-factor, dynamic and irregular. This article presents a novel approach which uses anomaly detection, machine learning and particle swarm optimization to achieve a cost-optimal cloud resource configuration. It is a complete solution which works in a closed loop without the need for external supervision or initialization, builds knowledge about the usage patterns of the system being optimized and filters out anomalous situations on the fly. Our solution can adapt to changes in both system load and the cloud provider's pricing plan. It was tested in Microsoft's cloud environment Azure using data collected from a real-life system. Experiments demonstrate that over a period of 10 months, a cost reduction of 85 percent was achieved.},

The primary concern for data recovery (DR) in the cloud is finding ways to ensure that the process of data backup and recovery is effective in providing high data availability, flexibility, and reliability at a reasonable cost. Numerous data backup solutions have been designed for a single-cloud architecture; however, making a single copy of data may not be sufficient because damage to data may cause irrecoverable loss during a disaster. Other solutions have involved multiple replications on more than one remote cloud provider (Multi-Cloud). Most suggested solutions have proposed obtaining a high level of reliability by producing at least three replicas of the data and either storing all replicas at a single location or distributing them over numerous remote locations. The drawbacks to this approach are high costs, large storage space consumption and (especially in the case of data-intensive cloud-based applications) increased network traffic. In this paper, we discuss the issues raised by DR for both Single-Cloud and Multi-Cloud environments. We also examine previous studies concerning cloud-based DR to highlight issues that researchers of cloud-based DR have considered to be most important.},

  abstract = {Purpose -- Start-up companies in particular can benefit from cloud computing services, since frequently they do not operate an internal IT infrastructure. The purpose of this paper is to present a total cost of ownership (TCO) approach for cloud computing services. Design/methodology/approach -- The authors applied a multi-method approach (systematic literature review, analysis of real cloud computing services, expert interviews, case study) for the development and evaluation of a formal mathematical TCO model. Findings -- It was found that decision processes in cloud computing are conducted ad hoc and lack systematic methods. The presented method raises the awareness of indirect and hidden costs in cloud computing. Research limitations/implications -- Some restrictive assumptions were made. For instance, cost types that focus on an existing internal IT infrastructure were hidden. Future research can combine risk and security aspects by means of a TCO approach. Additionally, benefits management in cloud computing is another new research field that can, for instance, be explored by means of cost-benefit analyses. Practical implications -- The analysis of relevant cost types and factors of cloud computing services is an important pillar of decision making in cloud computing. The software tool allows for an easy application of the TCO model with reasonable effort. Originality/value -- The paper provides an evaluated mathematical model for the calculation of the TCO of cloud computing services. With this tool, decision makers are able to decide whether outsourcing into the cloud is monetarily attractive; to be more specific, whether the costs associated with cloud computing services are lower than with a pre-existing infrastructure.},

At the same time, we are observing a fragmentation of the market in terms of pricing schemes, virtual machine offers and value-add features. In the early phase of cloud adoption, the price model was dominated by fixed prices. However, cloud market trend shows that dynamic pricing schemes utilization is being increased. In this plan, prices change according to demand in each cloud provider. In general, it is difficult for users to search cloud prices and decide where to put their resources. In this paper, we propose a scheduling model for optimizing virtual cluster placements across available cloud offers. This scheduler uses some variables such as average prices or cloud prices trends for suggesting an optimal deployment. Also, this scheduler is part of a cloud broker which automates actions and makes them transparent for users. The performance of our model is evaluated in a real-world cloud environment and the results show that user's investment decreases when part of the virtual infrastructure is dynamically distributed among clouds instead of maintaining it in a fixed one.},

  abstract = {Cloud providers sell their idle capacity on markets through an auction-like mechanism to increase their return on investment. The instances sold in this way are called spot instances. In spite that spot instances are usually 90\% cheaper than on-demand instances, they can be terminated by provider when their bidding prices are lower than market prices. Thus, they are largely used to provision fault-tolerant applications only. In this paper, we explore how to utilize spot instances to provision web applications, which are usually considered as availability-critical. The idea is to take advantage of differences in price among various types of spot instances to reach both high availability and significant cost saving. We first propose a fault-tolerant model for web applications provisioned by spot instances. Based on that, we devise novel cost-efficient auto-scaling polices that comply with the defined fault-tolerant semantics for hohowpublishedy billed cloud markets. We implemented the proposed model and policies both on a simulation testbed for repeatable validation and Amazon EC2. The experiments on the simulation testbed and EC2 show that the proposed approach can greatly reduce resource cost and still achieve satisfactory Quality of Service (QoS) in terms of response time and availability.},

In this context, the possibility to store a huge amount of data and files on remote third-party Cloud storage providers is becoming an even more concrete practice. Unfortunately, there is not any guarantee regarding data availability and reliability of such providers. In such a context, if the Cloud wants to use the storage as a service of another Cloud, it has only to trust it. A possible solution consists of using a Multi-Cloud Storage (MCS) system. However, how organizations should compose their own MCS system on geo-distribution basis is not trivial at all. In this paper, we specifically discuss how to optimize the overall system in terms of data storage and retrieval by testing and validating a MCS system composed of three major Cloud Storage providers; Dropbox, Google Drive and Copy. Experiments have proved that the choice of the Cloud storage providers where to store files depends on the data transfer performance according to the file chunk size. In addition, we demonstrated that not always the provider that offers the best performance in upload also offers the best performance in download.},

Service unavailability does not affect just user experience but is also translated into direct costs for cloud providers and companies. Part of this costs is due to SLA breaches, once interruption time greater than those signed in the contract generate financial penalties. Thus, cloud providers have tried to identify failure points and estimate the availability of their services. This paper proposes models to assess the availability of services running in a cloud data center infrastructure. The models follow the TIA-942 standard. We propose Tier I and IV models using the Reliability Block Diagram (RBD) to allow modeling of different types of applications, and Stochastic Petri Net (SPN) to represent the failure behavior of information technology (IT) components in a data center. We perform stationary analysis to measure the service availability, and sensitivity analysis to understand which metrics have major impacts on data center availability.},

However, it is more flexible than traditional ITO because no service volumes and no long contract periods need to be fixed. Companies that employ cloud computing may use several cloud service suppliers at the same time. Similarly, many companies that employ traditional ITO have contracts with several vendors. If the rendered services need to be coordinated, additional efforts are needed to manage this multi-sourcing environment. We find that the coordination arrangements known in multi-sourcing also occur in multi-cloud computing, but that significant differences exist in the actual coordination implementation. Based on the technology applied in cloud computing, new software has been developed to automate the integration tasks. In addition, many new players who offer coordination of multiple clouds as a service have entered the market.},

To address the problem of optimal VM selection, we present PARIS, a data-driven system that uses a novel hybrid offline and online data collection and modeling framework to provide accurate performance estimates with minimal data collection. PARIS is able to predict workload performance for different user-specified metrics, and resulting costs for a wide range of VM types and workloads across multiple cloud providers. When compared to sophisticated baselines, including collaborative filtering and a linear interpolation model using measured workload performance on two VM types, PARIS produces significantly better estimates of performance. For instance, it reduces runtime prediction error by a factor of 4 for some workloads on both AWS and Azure. The increased accuracy translates into a 45\% reduction in user cost while maintaining performance.},

However, the traditional approach of using a single cloud has several limitations in terms of availability, avoiding vendor lock-in, and providing legislation-compliant services with suitable Quality of Experience (QoE) to users worldwide. One way for cloud clients to mitigate these issues is to use multiple clouds (i.e., a Multi-Cloud). In this article, we introduce an approach for deploying three-tier applications across multiple clouds in order to satisfy their key nonfunctional requirements. We propose adaptive, dynamic, and reactive resource provisioning and load distribution algorithms that heuristically optimize overall cost and response delays without violating essential legislative and regulatory requirements. Our simulation with realistic workload, network, and cloud characteristics shows that our method improves the state of the art in terms of availability, regulatory compliance, and QoE with acceptable sacrifice in cost and latency.},

The three predominant service models are infrastructure, platform, and software-asa-service. Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) can be defined as the use of servers, storage, and virtualization to enable utility like services for users. Security is a big concern within IaaS, especially considering that the rest of the cloud service models run on top of the infrastructure and related layers. Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) providers offer access to APIs, programming languages and development middleware which allows subscribers to develop custom applications without installing or configuring the development environment. Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) gives subscribed or pay-peruse users access to software or services which reside in the cloud and not on the user's device. Understanding the cloud service models is critical in determining if cloud services or hosting are an appropriate business solution, and if so, which model best balances the level of control required versus reduced hardware, configuration, and maintenance costs. Cloud computing offers many benefits to organizations; it has enabled collaboration amongst disparate communities and workgroups, and has overcome challenges that have plagued existing business solutions. However, the security, privacy, and integrity of the cloud are of prime importance and there are many challenges that exist. At the present time there seems to be a lot of momentum behind the adoption of cloud computing despite these. This may simply be a trend, an indication that society truly wants their data to be available whenever from anywhere, or a sign that few understand the associated risks.},

  abstract = {Cloud computing is a new computing paradigm that allows users with different computing demands to access a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., servers, network, storage, database, applications and services). Many commercial cloud providers have emerged in the past 6-7 years, and each typically provides its own cloud infrastructure, APIs and application description formats to access the cloud resources, as well as support for service level agreements (SLAs). Such vendor lock-in has seriously limited the flexibility that cloud end users would like to process, when it comes to deploy applications over different infrastructures in different geographic locations, or to migrate a service from one provider's cloud to another. To enable seamless sharing of resources from a pool of cloud providers, efforts have emerged recently to facilitate cloud interoperability, i.e., the ability for multiple cloud providers to work together, from both the industry and academia. In this article, we conduct a comprehensive survey on the state-of-the-art efforts, with a focus on interoperability among different IaaS (infrastructure as a service) cloud platforms. We investigate the existing studies on taxonomies and standardization of cloud interoperability, as well as practical cloud technologies from both the cloud provider's and user's perspectives to enable interoperation. We pose issues and challenges to advance the topic area, and hope to pave a way for the forthcoming research.},

However, there are no available tools proper for cost calculation and analysis in Cloudenvironment. This paper presents our efforts towards filling in the gap. We format suits of metrics and formulas for the calculation of Cloud Total Cost of Ownership(TCO) and Utilization Cost, considering the elastic feature of Cloud infrastructure and widely adopted virtualization technology in Cloud. This provides afoundation for evaluating economic efficiency of Cloud and provides indications for cost optimization of Cloud.We have developed our calculation and analysis approach into a web tool which is used in the internal Cloud environment and demonstrate initially its analysis capability on the cost distribution and utilization imbalance factor.},

  abstract = {With the offer from cloud computing providers, scientists have the opportunity to utilize pay-as-you-go resources together with their own and shared resources. However, scientists need to decide which parts of their applications should be executed in cloud computing systems in order to balance the trade-off between cost, time and resource requirements. In this paper, we present a service for estimating, monitoring and analyzing costs associated with scientific applications in the cloud. Cost models associated with different application execution models are proposed and these cost models can be composed to determine costs of different scenarios. We present techniques to estimate costs for service dependency and to monitor costs associated with typical scientific applications. Experiments with real-world applications are performed to illustrate the usefulness of our techniques. Our service could eventually be integrated into cloud resource management and execution services to support on-the-fly resource scheduling.},

For monitoring the certain resource, we should utilize not only a cloud management module but also a network management module. However, it is difficult to check the duration time and to observe the digested information about the resources. To investigate these problems in a cloud computing environment, we designed and deployed the cloud service infrastructure based on open-source software, namely, CloudStack. The proposed model regularly stores the usage data for computing resources based on Hadoop and HBase. In addition, our model analyzes the raw data for virtual machines and makes an effective recommendation regarding the consumption of computing resources.},

Although Cloud computing has many benefits and has the ability to increase an organizations return on investment, there are many issues such as ethical issues, security issues, data lock-in, lack of standardization, customization, technology bottlenecks, strategy issues etc. which are preventing managements of organizations from adopting cloud computing. As a result of this, it is important for managements of these organizations to be aware of the issues with cloud computing that could affect their implementation success. In order to identify the issues and propose ways to resolve these issues, this paper discusses the different management issues with cloud computing that have been identified by literature and suggests possible ways to resolve them. This paper also suggests that proper investigation into these issues and how to resolve them will increase management's confidence in cloud computing and ensure successful adoption and implementation of cloud computing.},

It comprises an assessment of the state of the art of uses of AI in the three focus areas, and a legal analysis of how IP laws currently apply to AI-assisted creative and innovative outputs. The report concludes that the current state of the art in AI does not require or justify immediate substantive changes in copyright and patent law in Europe. The existing concepts of copyright and patent law are sufficiently abstract and flexible to meet the current challenges from AI. In addition, related rights regimes potentially extend to `authorless' AI productions in a variety of sectors, and the sui generis database right may offer protection to AI-produced databases resulting from substantial investment. However, taking into account the practical implications of AI technologies, the report identifies specific avenues for future legal reform (if justified by empirical evidence), offers recommendations for improvements in the application of existing rules (e.g. via guidelines), and highlights the need to study the role of alternative IP regimes to protect AI-assisted outputs, such as trade secret protection, unfair competition and contract law.},

Auf juristische Fragestellungen angewandt stellt sich die Frage von rechtlichen L{\"u}cken bei Handlungen KI-basierter Maschinen, insbesondere bei Haftung und Zurechnung von Ertr{\"a}gen aus Leistungen. Damit stellt sich die Frage, ob das Spektrum der bisher rechtlich geregelten Rechtspers{\"o}nlichkeiten -- nat{\"u}rliche und juristische Personen -- der Erweiterung bedarf. Ausgehend von dem diesbez{\"u}glichen Vorschlag des Europ{\"a}ischen Parlaments f{\"u}r eine ,,elektronische Person`` und einer kritischen Betrachtung dieser neuen Rechtspers{\"o}nlichkeit werden Umfang und Grenzen eines solchen Konstruktes untersucht und die sich daraus ergebenden Folgefragen er{\"o}rtert.},

  abstract = {Against the backdrop of the current discussion of how AI reshapes certain IP paradigms, this chapter reassesses the need for IP protection in AI markets per se. We assess the question of justification of IP rights for both AI as a tool and AI-generated output in light of the very theoretical foundations of IP protection (from both legal embedded deontological and utilitarian economic standpoints). Traditionally, IP is granted due to deontological reasoning according to which a human creator's efforts and personality have to be awarded and protected, and economic reasoning, according to which exclusive rights in intangible goods have to be established in order to remedy market failure in public goods markets. IP ought to serve as a regulatory system of stimulation of creation and innovation using market forces to achieve this goal. Based on the current state of knowledge however, it seems that specific market implications of the widespread use of most AI applications may have altered the justification for AI-related IP protection in certain cases. Whereas this seems particularly true regarding AI tools, the case for AI outputs may be different.},
